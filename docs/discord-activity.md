# OpenShock Discord Activity

A Discord Activity (an iframe app launched from a voice channel) where users log in, link their
OpenShock account, manage shockers and whitelist, and — the headline feature — join a shared room
and shock each other in real time, governed by a consent model.

## Architecture

```
Discord client (voice channel)
        │  loads iframe (Embedded App SDK: OAuth, instanceId, participants)
        ▼
<APP_ID>.discordsays.com ── two URL mappings ──┬─ "/"    → activity.openshock.app      (Cloudflare Pages)
        (browser fetches /api/… , SignalR)     └─ "/api" → activity-api.openshock.app  (cloudflared → k8s)
                                                              │  (Discord strips the "/api" prefix)
   SvelteKit SPA ──Bearer JWT──────────────────────────────► ASP.NET BFF
                                                              ├─► Postgres (shared EF context)
                                                              └─► OpenShock SDK ─► OpenShock API
```

### Projects

| Project | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `OpenShock.DiscordBot.Shared` | Class library: EF `OpenShockDiscordContext` + entities, migrations, `ApiUtils.GetApiClient()`, `OpenShockBackendService`. Referenced by the bot **and** the API. |
| `OpenShock.DiscordBot` | The existing Discord bot (unchanged behavior). |
| `OpenShock.Activity.Api` | New ASP.NET Core BFF: Discord OAuth token exchange, REST + SignalR over the shared DB/SDK. |
| `activity/` | SvelteKit 5 SPA (the Activity frontend). |

## Configuration (API)

Bound from the `Activity` config section, plus a shared top-level `Db` section. Non-secret defaults
live in `appsettings.json`; secrets come from user-secrets (local) or env vars
(`Activity__Discord__ClientSecret`, `Db__Conn`, …) in production.

| Key | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `Activity:Discord:ClientId` | `1096380937496969326` (public). |
| `Activity:Discord:ClientSecret` | From the Discord Dev Portal → OAuth2. **Secret.** |
| `Activity:Jwt:Key` | HMAC signing key for our session JWT (≥ 32 bytes). **Secret.** |
| `Db:Conn` | Postgres connection string. **Shared with the bot** — one top-level section, so `Db__Conn` is set once and both processes read it (and the shared user-secrets store holds a single entry). **Secret.** |
| `Activity:CorsOrigins` | Dev only — allowed browser origins for `pnpm dev`. |

## Discord Developer Portal

1. **Activities → Enable** the embedded app.
2. **OAuth2**: scopes `identify` and `application_identities.write` (the latter for the profile widget). Generate a **client secret** → `Activity:Discord:ClientSecret`.
3. **Activities → URL Mappings** (two):
   - `/` → `activity.openshock.app` (frontend)
   - `/api` → `activity-api.openshock.app` (API)

   Discord **strips the mapping prefix**, so `/api/me` in the browser reaches the API as `/me`. The API
   deliberately serves its routes at root; the `/api` prefix is browser-side only.

## Profile widget (Game Stats Widget)

Users who open the Activity grant `application_identities.write`, which lets the bot write their OpenShock
control stats to their Discord profile widget through the
[Application Identity Profile API](https://docs.discord.com/developers/resources/application-identity-profile).
The Activity API only records the grant (`users.widget_authorized`); the **bot** does the syncing.

`WidgetSyncService` (bot) ticks every `bot:Widget:Interval` (default 1 min) and makes **one** request per tick
to the OpenShock API's `POST /1/integrations/control-stats/changes`, authorized with an automation token
granting `ControlStatsRead` (`bot:Widget:AutomationToken`, create it in the admin panel). The API answers with
the lifetime totals of only those users whose stats changed since the previous cursor; users the bot sees for
the first time get a full sync. A widget is only written when its data differs from what was last written,
cleared when the user unlinks or re-links another account, and the grant is dropped if Discord answers `403`.
Users linked to a server other than `bot:Widget:ApiServer` (default `https://api.openshock.app/`) are skipped.

| Config (bot) | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `bot:Widget:AutomationToken` | Automation token with `ControlStatsRead`. Sync is off when unset. **Secret.** |
| `bot:Widget:ApiServer` | OpenShock API to read stats from. |
| `bot:Widget:Interval` | Sync interval, e.g. `00:01:00`. |

Map these **User Data** keys in the Developer Portal widget layout (all number dynamic fields; *received* is
activity on the user's own shockers, *given* is what they sent, their own shockers included):

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `shocks_received` / `shocks_given` | Shock count |
| `vibrations_received` / `vibrations_given` | Vibrate count |
| `sounds_received` / `sounds_given` | Sound count |
| `shock_seconds_received` / `shock_seconds_given` | Total shock duration in seconds |
| `max_shock_intensity_received` / `max_shock_intensity_given` | Highest shock intensity |

Users who only ever used the bot's slash commands haven't granted the scope, so their widget stays empty
until they open the Activity once.

## Hosting

- **Frontend:** Cloudflare Pages project (build `activity/`, adapter-cloudflare) on `activity.openshock.app`.
- **Backend:** `OpenShock.Activity.Api` in Kubernetes, exposed to Cloudflare via **cloudflared** on
  `activity-api.openshock.app`. See [`deploy/cloudflared-activity-api.yaml`](../deploy/cloudflared-activity-api.yaml)
  and [`OpenShock.Activity.Api/Dockerfile`](../OpenShock.Activity.Api/Dockerfile). WebSockets (SignalR)
  work through both the Discord proxy and cloudflared natively.

Because every browser request is same-origin (`discordsays.com`), there is **no CORS in production** and
sessions use a **Bearer JWT** (not cookies, which are unreliable in the proxied iframe).

## Database migration

The consent columns (`allow_room_shocks`, `room_max_intensity`, `room_max_duration_ms`) ship as the
`AddRoomConsent` EF migration in the Shared project. Apply it:

```bash
dotnet ef database update --project OpenShock.DiscordBot.Shared --startup-project MigrationHelper
```

(The bot also auto-applies pending migrations on startup unless `Db:SkipMigration` is set.)

## Consent model

- **Whitelist** (persistent): you may shock someone only if they have whitelisted you — the existing
  bot semantics (`UsersFriendwhitelist`).
- **Room consent** (session, opt-in): if a user enables "allow room participants to shock me", anyone
  in the *same Discord Activity instance* may shock them **without** a whitelist entry, clamped to that
  user's `RoomMaxIntensity` / `RoomMaxDurationMs`.

The `/control` endpoint enforces: self → allow; whitelisted → allow; else room-consent + same instance
(clamped) → allow; otherwise `403`.

## Local development

```bash
# 1. API (needs Postgres reachable at Activity:Db:Conn with the migration applied)
dotnet run --project OpenShock.Activity.Api          # http://localhost:5199 (set ASPNETCORE_URLS)

# 2. Frontend
cd activity && pnpm install && pnpm dev              # http://localhost:5173
```

For API-only testing without Discord, the Development environment exposes `POST /dev/token
{ "discordId": "…", "name": "…" }` which mints a session JWT you can use as a Bearer token against the
REST endpoints.

### Testing the real Activity inside Discord (URL override)

The Embedded App SDK only works **inside Discord**, and the iframe's CSP won't let the browser call
`localhost` directly. Discord's per-user **Activity URL override** only replaces the root (`/`) target —
sub-path mappings like `/api` still resolve to your *prod* host. So for local debugging, collapse
everything onto **one origin**: the Vite dev server serves the frontend **and** proxies `/api` (and the
SignalR WebSocket) to the local API. Only the root override is needed — no `/api` mapping locally.

The proxy is already configured in `vite.config.ts` (`/api` → `VITE_API_PROXY_TARGET`, default
`http://localhost:5199`, `ws: true`, prefix stripped so it matches the API's root routes).

```bash
# 1. API
dotnet run --project OpenShock.Activity.Api           # ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://localhost:5199
# 2. Frontend (serves app + proxies /api to the API)
cd activity && pnpm dev                                # http://localhost:5173
# 3. Expose Vite to Discord over HTTPS
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5173         # copy the https://<random>.trycloudflare.com URL
```

Then in Discord → your app → **Activities → set the URL override** to the tunnel URL and launch the
Activity from a voice channel. `server.allowedHosts` is already `true` so Vite accepts the tunnel host.
(HMR over the tunnel can be flaky — a manual refresh always works.)

## Endpoints (served at root; browser calls them under `/api`)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/auth/token` | Exchange a Discord OAuth code for a session JWT. |
| GET | `/me` | Link + consent status. |
| POST/DELETE | `/link` | Link / unlink an OpenShock account. |
| GET/PUT | `/shockers` | List / choose enabled shockers. |
| GET | `/whitelist`, POST/DELETE `/whitelist/{id}` | Manage who may shock you. |
| GET/PUT | `/consent` | Room-consent toggle + caps. |
| POST | `/control` | Shock/vibrate/sound a target (permission-checked). |
| WS | `/hubs/room?instanceId=…` | SignalR room: roster, join/leave, consent, live shock feed. |
